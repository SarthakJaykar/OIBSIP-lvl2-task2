			<p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 - 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.</p>
			<p>In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the nickname Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father".</p>

			<h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
			<p>Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) (now in Madhya Pradesh). He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar. His family’s low caste status resulted in his early life being marked by discrimination, segregation and untouchability.</p>
			<p>Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning a law degree and various doctorates from Columbia University and the London School of Economics, and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and political science. In his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India.</p>
            <p>He was also among the highest educated Indians of his generation. During his three years at Columbia University, Ambedkar took twenty nine courses in economics, eleven in history, six in sociology, five in philosophy, four in anthropology, three in politics and one each in elementary French and German!</p>

			<h2>Contributions and Achievements</h2>
			<p>For constitution making- The Indian Constitution and its drafting process are often seen as synonymous with Ambedkar. He was the Chairman of the Assembly’s most crucial committee – the Drafting Committee and a member of other important Committees. As its Chairman, he had to defend the Draft Constitution which the Committee prepared, and therefore intervened in nearly every debate. A mini-Constitution in itself, States and Minorities framed strong constitutional protection for the Scheduled Caste community.</p>
			<p>Later contribution- Ambedkar was appointed as the first Law Minister of independent India in 1947. Ambedkar’s ideas as presented in the Hilton Young Commission served as an inspiration behind the creation of the Reserve Bank of India. In 1956, Ambedkar along with 3,65,000 supporters converted to Buddhism, after having devoted several years to studying the religion. As a Scheduled Caste Federation party candidate, Ambedkar contested in India’s first general elections from Bombay North Central constituency.</p>

			<h2>Key Writings and Thoughts</h2>
			<p>Dr Ambedkar wrote several books in his lifetime. He wrote three books on economics – “Administration and Finance of the East India Company“; “The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India“; and “The Problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Its Solution“.  “The Annihilation of Caste”, based on a speech he was supposed to give, is considered one of the most authoritative works on Dalit life and politics till date. His other writings include “What Congress and Gandhi have done to the Untouchables“, and “Pakistan or the Partition of India“. The Ministry of External Affairs has also published his entire collection of written works and speeches in 17 volumes.</p>
